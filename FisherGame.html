                    In <b>Untitled Fisher Game</b>, players control the fisherman on the boat where they are trying to
                    catch as much
                    fish as possible. However, cars passing by are throwing trash into the lake so you are also tasked
                    with cleaning the lake to meet the fish quota before time runs out.<br>

                    This SVC Hackathon (Game Jam Game) project was completed within 72 hours, and our team got 2nd
                    place. We are a four-person team, and I worked as a programmer and designer.
                    In programming, I was responsible for the Viechle and Trash throwing system, UI programming, and
                    Audio implementation.

                        In the game's background environment, two tunnels facilitate the spawning of vehicles traveling
                        in opposite directions. These vehicles have a unique behavior: dispense trash into a lake while
                        navigating the terrain and vanishing after completing a full lap. I used Unity's AI NavMesh
                        Pathfinding features to achieve this automated driving behavior.<br>
                        <video autoplay loop controls>
                            <source src="video/CarScene.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        </video><br>

                        To enable the vehicles to auto-drive on the right road, I created a NavMesh on the road and
                        assigned a Mesh Agent to each vehicle. The NavMesh guides the vehicle along a designated path to
                        a predefined destination. However, the NavMesh is limited, as it always finds the shortest
                        distance between the starting position and the destination, which canâ€™t apply on a circular
                        path. Addressing this, I implemented a strategy to manually guide the vehicle along a circular
                        route.<br>
                        <img src="images/Car.gif"><br>
                        My solution is setting multiple path nodes as temp destinations to guide the vehicle toward its
                        final
                        objective progressively. This was accomplished by segmenting the road into distinct checkpoints.
                        As the vehicle successfully passed each checkpoint (pathNode), its destination was dynamically
                        updated to the subsequent checkpoint on the NavMesh map.<br>
                        <img src="images/Car2.gif"><br>
                        <img src="images/pathNode.png"><br>
                        This iterative process continued until
                        the vehicle reached the final checkpoint, signaling the completion of one full lap.
                        <br>

                    <li>Viechle Trash Throwing <i class="fa fa-caret-down" onclick="hideBlock('resources')"
                            style="cursor:pointer"></i>
                    </li>
                    <div id="resources" style="display: none;">

                        In implementing the vehicle randomly generates trash and dumps trash, I have tied the generate
                        chance with path nodes along the vehicle's path. The logic is that each path node has a preset
                        trash-throwing chance variable, and as a vehicle passes a node, its controller will assess this
                        chance variable.<br>
                        <img src="images/pathNodeInspector.png">
                        Subsequently, based on this chance, the vehicle's controller will decide
                        whether to execute the trash disposal action or not. If yes, the controller will instantiate a
                        trash collectable at the spawner position and set the velocity direction to the lake's
                        center.<br>
                        <img src="images/DropTrash.png"> <br> <img src="images/ThrowTrash.png"> <br>

                    </div>
                    <li> Randomized Trash Generation<i class="fa fa-caret-down" onclick="hideBlock('mod')"
                            style="cursor:pointer"></i></li>
                    <div id="mod" style="display: none;">

                        There are three different sizes of trash in the game: Small, Medium, and Large.To specify the
                        size for each trash collectable in scripts and prefab, I used the enum TrashType.
                        This enumeration facilitates access for the TrashManager to know the size of each collectable.
                        Based on their size, each trash collectable has different spawning chance. Small trash has the
                        largest chance of spawning, while Large trash has the least chance of spawning.
                        <img src="images/TrashCollectable.png"> <br>
                        Since the RNG generator in Unity is likely to generate uneven results, I added weights for each
                        trash
                        collectible. Using a weighted random selection algorithm can create a balanced trash spawning
                        system and enhance the player experience by avoiding spawning large trash in a row.<br>
