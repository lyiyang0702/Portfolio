                    <b>Witch Skater</b> is a multiplayer game and the goal is to use the fans to propel yourself or blow
                    others into traps or off the map with a big fan.<br>
                    The prompt of this game is to design a game around two
                    verbs: <b>Skate</b> and <b>Blow</b> . We went through a variety of pitches before settling on making a PVP
                    platformer arena game with players on skateboards and giant fans. The physics and movement of the
                    game simulate a skateboard, with no friction and being carried by your momentum, and the blow aspect
                    was incorporated through the large fans the players carried.

                        In Dracomaton, items play a crucial role by introducing both positive and negative effects on
                        players that significantly impact gameplay. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc11.gif">
                        <img src="images/ItemOverview.png"><br>
                        My responsibilities involved establishing the foundation for the item system. This encompassed
                        creating a framework for generating new items, adding distinctive effects to each item, and
                        implementing the mechanics for applying these effects to the player. To achieve this, I used
                        Unity's ScriptableObjects to devise a base class, BaseItem, which serves as the base prefabs for
                        all future items. Each base item owns unique attributes such as id, icon, and employs Item Stats
                        Mods & Item Status Mods to manage its distinctive effects. When the Apply function in the base
                        item script gets called, it will add all the mods(aka. effects) to its host damage
                        source/damageable, mostly player.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/ItemCode.png"><br>
                        Considering that designers will collaborate on items throughout the development, I designed a
                        user-friendly system that allows designers to swiftly test and tweak item attributes during
                        tests by adjusting parameters directly in the Inspector.<br>

                    </li>
                    <div id="ui" style="display: none;">

                        In Dracomaton, random objects need to be spawned on the map under different situations, for
                        example, shop items are randomly selected from all the items in the game. To address the random
                        spawning of objects, including shop items. This system organizes all game resources, such as UI
                        icons, Damage Text, and VFX, into a unified structure.<br>
                        <h2> Resources Manager</h2>
                        The Resource Manager, implemented as a singleton class, efficiently fetches resource objects and
                        categorizes them based on type when awake.<br>
                        <img src="images/ResourcesManager.png"> <img src="images/fetchItem.png"> <img
                            src="images/rmscript.png"><br>
                        For code clarity, I used partial class to separate the code into different files. Individual
                        resource managers also make generating a random object more easily by just calling the function
                        in the corresponding manager script, and programmers can create many single manager scripts
                        without complicated primary resources manager script.<br>

                        <h2> Reward System</h2>
                        In Dracomaton, players receive varied rewards based on the type of room they complete,
                        for example, clearing a health room will reward the player a health portion. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc8.gif"> <img src="images/dc10.gif"><br>
                        The Reward Spawner selects the reward type based on the current room's type from reading the
                        current room controller, and the Reward Script ensures appropriate spawning within reachable
                        areas (e.g. avoid water area) near the player.
                        <br>

                        <h2> Shop System</h2>
                        As for the Shop System, I was responsible for offering three shop items (mostly the same object
                        as rewards) in the Shop room to players. One item is always a Health portion for game balance,
                        and the other is a random type of object (items, forms, etc). <br>
                        <img src="images/dc9.gif"><br>
                        A prefab with preset spawning methods facilitates the placement of shop items on the screen,
                        which can be easily placed in any position on the map. Shop Room Manager populates three shop
                        item positions, and the attached Shop Item Spawning Script manages object spawning on these
                        positions. The variable "Item Type" in the spawning script decides the type of spawned objects,
                        for instance, if item type is Random, it means this position will spawn a random object,
                        otherwise, it will only spawn the selected type of item.<br>
