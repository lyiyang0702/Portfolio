                    <b>Witch Riders</b> is a multiplayer game and the goal is to use the fans to propel yourself or blow
                    others into traps or off the map with a big fan.<br>
                    The prompt of this game is to design a game around two
                    verbs: <b>Skate</b> and <b>Blow</b> . We went through a variety of pitches before settling on making
                    a PVP
                    platformer arena game with players on skateboards and giant fans. The physics and movement of the
                    game simulate a skateboard, with no friction and being carried by your momentum, and the blow aspect
                    was incorporated through the large fans the players carried.

                            style="cursor:pointer"></i> </li>
                    <div id="multi" style="display: none;">
                        In a PVP arena game, local multiplayer is very important as part of the core gameplay.
                        Therefore, I have used Unity's <b>new input system</b> to facilitate gameplay for up to four
                        players,
                        each using distinct controllers. First, I created an Input Action Asset which organized all
                        relevant in-game actions into a group of action maps, distinguishing between UI and Player
                        controls.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/UIActions_WR.png">
                        <img src="images/PlayerActions_WR.png"><br>
                        Next, I used the PlayerInput component within Unity’s new Input System to manage input across
                        multiple players, customizing actions based on each player's input devices and unique action
                        maps, for example, the controller player needs to press South Button to jump, but the keyboard
                        needs to press Space. <br>
                        <img src="images/playerInput.png"><br>

                        However, the normal event system doesn’t support handling multiple UI
                        input. To address this, I used an additional component called the "Input System UI Input
                        Module," enabling the integration of the Input System with the UI system. This ensures players
                        can seamlessly interact with UI elements, such as buttons and sliders on menu scenes or other UI
                        scenes. For example, controller players can also navigate through buttons.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/eventSystem.png"><br>
                    </div>
                    <li> UI Programming <i class="fa fa-caret-down" onclick="hideBlock('ui')"
                            style="cursor:pointer"></i>
                    </li>
                    <div id="ui" style="display: none;">

                        I am responsible for all the UI implementation in this game, including the Main Menu, Pause
                        Menu, Player Selection Screen, Level Selection Screen, and more. In the Player Selection Screen,
                        the player's sprite starts in a default dark hue and dynamically shifts to distinct colors as
                        each player joins.<br>
                        <!-- add image -->
                        The select player manager has a list of player slot ui references, and the activate function
                        will be called every time a player joins.<br>
                        <img src="images/SelectSceneManager.png">
                        <img src="images/playerSlotUI.png">
                        <img src="images/SelectPlayerController.png"><br>

                        Once all desired players have joined, they can press the "Next" button to navigate to the level
                        selection screen, where they can choose from three different levels before starting the game.
                        The Select Level Controller works similarly to the Player Select Controller but will call the
                        Multiplayer Manager to instantiate the selected Level Prefab. Players can return to the previous
                        player selection screen if they want to adjust the number of players.<br>
                        <!-- add image -->
                        Throughout gameplay, players can access the pause menu at any time, providing various choices:
                        "Restart" directs them to the main menu, "Resume" lifts the pause, and "Tutorial" displays a
                        panel offering control instructions. If only one player remains alive in the game, the game
                        concludes with an ending scene. Players then have the option to restart the game or quit the
                        game.
