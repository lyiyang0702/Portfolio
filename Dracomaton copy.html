                    <h2 id="project-title">What part did I do? </h2>

                    <li >Item System/Item <i class= "fa fa-caret-down" onclick="hideBlock('item')" style="cursor:pointer"></i> </li>
                    <div id="item" style="display: none;">
                        In Dracomaton, an item is an object that can have negative or positive effects on player which
                        adds a lot of variances to gameplay.<br>
                        <img src="images/dc11.gif">
                        <img src="images/ItemOverview.png"><br>
                        I was responsible for initializing the framework of item system, including how to create a new
                        item; how to make each item has its unique effect; how to apply item’s effect to player etc.<br>
                        To resolve those problems, I have used Unity’s <b>ScriptableObjects</b> to create a base class:
                        <b>BaseItem</b>, which all the future items can inherit from. Each base item has its own info
                        such as id, icon, and Item Stats Mods & Item Status Mods are the part that takes care of item’s
                        unique effect. The way it works is that when the Apply function in base item script get called,
                        it will add all the mods(aka. effects) to its host damage source/damageable, mostly player.<br>
                        <img src="images/ItemCode.png"><br>
                        Considering that designers will collaborate on items throughout the development, I created a
                        designer-friendly system so they can easily test and tweak the item strength during the test by
                        simply changing the attributes on the inspector.<br>
                        <img src="images/ItemInspector.png"><br>
                    </div>
                    <li >Resources Management System (Rewards,
                        Shops) <i class= "fa fa-caret-down" onclick="hideBlock('resources')" style="cursor:pointer"></i></li>
                    <div id="resources" style="display: none;">

                        In Dracomaton, random objects need to be spawned on the map under different situations, for
                        example, shop items are randomly selected from all the items in the game. Therefore, I created a
                        <b>Resource Management System</b> to organize all the rewards/resources in the game to work as a
                        general helper function, including every type of resource, such as UI icons, Damage Text, and
                        even VFX. Both the <b>Shop system</b> and <b>Reward system</b> utilized the Resource Manager.

                        <h2> Resources Manager</h2>
                        To explain how the resource management system works, the <b>ResourcesManager.cs</b> is a
                        singleton
                        class that fetches resource objects (prefabs) from the project folders to separate lists when
                        awake.<br>
                        <img src="images/ResourcesManager.png"> <img src="images/fetchItem.png"> <img
                            src="images/rmscript.png"><br>
                        For code clarity, I made all the individual managers as a partial class of
                        <b>ResourcesManager.cs</b>, which allows each resource type to have its own
                        manager to make the code more readable and generate a random object more easily by just calling
                        the function in the corresponding manager-script. Since each manager script is individual,
                        programmers can create many single manager scripts without complicated primary resources manager
                        script.<br>
                        <img src="images/returnItems.png"><br>

                        <h2> Reward System</h2>
                        For the reward system, In Dracomaton, players will get different rewards (Items, Forms etc.)
                        based on the room they entered and finished, for example, clearing a health room will reward the
                        player a health portion. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc8.gif"> <img src="images/dc10.gif"><br>
                        Various room types will emerge in the game loop as the game progresses.
                        When a new room is loaded, the reward spawner script will decide the reward type from the current
                        room’s type (stored in the room controller). After the player clears the room, the reward script
                        will detect the tiles on the tilemap in a specific range to ensure the reward spawns in a
                        reachable place (not water). If the reward type is items or forms, the reward will be the
                        items/objects randomly returned by their manager script.<br>

                        <img src="images/rewardSpawners.png"> <img src="images/spawnRewards.png"><br>
                        Various room types will emerge in the game loop as the game progresses. Therefore, I created a
                        resource management system to organize all the rewards/resources in the game to work as a
                        general helper function, including every type of resource, such as UI icons, Damage Text, and
                        even VFX.<br>


                        <h2> Shop System</h2>
                        I was responsible for offering three shop items (mostly the same object as
                        rewards) in the shop room for players. One of the three items is always a Health portion for
                        game balance reason and the other two can be randomly chosen from any possible objects. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc9.gif"><br>
                        The way I fulfill these is by making a shop item position prefab that has been preset a spawning
                        method,
                        which allows it to be easily moved to any position on the screen and it is. For example, if the
                        item type is Random, it means this position will spawn a random item, otherwise, it will only
                        spawn the selected type of item. Once the shop room is awake, the shop room manager will
                        populate three shop item positions in the game.

                    </div>
                    <li > UI <i class= "fa fa-caret-down" onclick="hideBlock('mod')" style="cursor:pointer"></i></li>
                    <div id="mod" style="display: none;">

                        <h2> Mod Menu </h2>
                        Mod Menu is the UI that is highly releated to Dracomaton's core gameplay, Forms and Mods. There
                        are two types of slots in the game: the
                        upper slots are Form slots, and the lower slots are Mods slots. The mechanics of Dracomaton is
                        that players can switch the form and mod by swapping their positions. For example, if players
                        drag Fire Form to the Construct Form’s mod slot, the code will automatically unequip Fire Form
                        and turn it into Construct Form’s mod. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc6.gif"><br>
                        I created the mod menu functions from scratch, including implementing UI assets, implementing
                        drag and drop functionals, and connecting UI with backend codes. n game design, switching
                        between forms and mods has various restrictions; for example, you can’t mod the same form (e.g.
                        construct mod can’t mod construct form), or you can’t equip the same Form twice, etc. I have
                        considered all these edge cases in UI to indicate to players the correct way to equip mods and
                        forms.
                        <img src="images/dc7.gif"><br>
                        <h2> Item Menu</h2>
                        Item Menu UI will pop out with three item options when the player clears an item room, and they
                        can read through the item description to select one to apply. They simply need to click the card
                        to use the item. If the item pool has less than three available items, it will only spawn two
                        items for selection.
                        <img src="images/dc11.gif"> <img src="images/itemSelection.png"><br>

                        Both the Mod Menu and Item Menu panels are toggleable.
