                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Firewise Citizen is a 3D top-down traffic simulation and educational game that teaches players
                        about wildfire evacuation. Players act as community leaders making critical decisions
                        during a wildfire evacuation to avoid loss and ensure safety. Each choice directly impacts the
                        evacuation’s final outcome, offering valuable lessons on emergency preparedness and response.

            <h3>Traffic Simulation</h3>
            <h4>Level Editor</h4>
            <p>To make level-editing easier, I set up a 3D <strong>grid-based</strong> grid-based map by projecting the
                2D grid onto the XZ plane,
                allowing designers to quickly draw roads and buildings with brush tools like in 2D game using Tilemap
                tools. Each cell has its own type: Road, Structure, Empty and be stored in the grid
                for future uses on the road/structure placing.
            </p>

                <img src="images/Gird.png" alt="Traffic Simulation Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div>
            <h4>Road System</h4>
            <p>For a more accurate traffic simulation, First I have set up a road system that can dynamically adjust
                each road assets by checking its neighbour cells direction(left, top, right, down) and rotate/modify the
                assets to align with the neighbour.
            </p>
            <div class="contribution-image-container">
                <img src="images/ATC_Road.gif" alt="Traffic Simulation Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div>
            <h4>Car AI</h4>
            <p>Second, I have built a Car AI system that uses a network of <strong>Markers</strong> and an
                <strong>Adjacency Graph</strong> to navigate
                the roads. I used an adjacency graph because it efficiently stores bidirectional markers and allows
                quick retrieval for pathfinding. Each road includes Marker objects that define specific positions and
                connect to adjacent
                markers that act as waypoints. These markers are added to an <code>AdjacencyGraph</code> where each
                Marker becomes a
                node (<code>Vertex</code>) with connections (<code>edges</code>) to its neighbors. The graph enables the
                AI to build flexible
                routes, and an <strong>A*</strong> algorithm calculates the shortest route between two points by
                evaluating
                the cost of moving from one marker to the next. This allows cars to handle turns, intersections, and
                even detours in a realistic way.
            </p>

                <p class="image-caption">The red and green markers represent opposite directions, with red lines
                    indicating valid paths between each marker and its neighboring markers</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Fire Simulation</h3>
            <p>For fire simulation, in order to make the wildfire spreading effect, I used collision to check with
                structure & nature layer . When fire touches a <code>Combustible</code> object, it gradually decreasing
                in size using
                <strong>Lerp</strong> (linear interpolation), which makes the burning simulation feel natural, as if the
                combustibles
                burning out over time.
            </p>
            <p>To make the fire movement even more realistic, I added a <code>Wind Zone</code> that affects the fire’s
                speed and
                direction. The wind move direction changes periodically, giving the fire a natural flow. The wind zone
                is designed to be easily adjusted as needed by changing its force, speed. range etc.</p>

                <img src="images/ATC_Wind.gif" alt="Fire Simulation Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div>

            <h3>Branching Narrative</h3>
            <p>For player making choices for the community (the core game play) , I used a <code>HouseTypeInfo</code>
                object to
                manage each house’s information, including the choices.( <code>HouseChoice</code> class) Each choice
                serves as a
                modification to the base properties of the structure, allowing for a flexible and modular approach to
                customization.
            </p>
            <p>To efficiently manage multiple options, I used a dictionary to hold all the choices player selected in a
                list per house type. This approach allows the UI to retrieve option status with an <strong>O(1)</strong>
                lookup time,
                optimizing performance and enabling seamless UI updates. The design supports multi-option menus,
                allowing players to freely adjust or revert selections before confirming changes, which enhances user
                experience and control.

                    <div id="multi" style="display: none;">
                        In a PVP arena game, local multiplayer is very important as part of the core gameplay.
                        Therefore, I have used Unity's <b>new input system</b> to facilitate gameplay for up to four
                        players,
                        each using distinct controllers. First, I created an Input Action Asset which organized all
                        relevant in-game actions into a group of action maps, distinguishing between UI and Player
                        controls.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/UIActions_WR.png">
                        <img src="images/PlayerActions_WR.png"><br>
                        Next, I used the PlayerInput component within Unity’s new Input System to manage input across
                        multiple players, customizing actions based on each player's input devices and unique action
                        maps, for example, the controller player needs to press South Button to jump, but the keyboard
                        needs to press Space. <br>
                        <img src="images/playerInput.png"><br>

                        However, the normal event system doesn’t support handling multiple UI
                        input. To address this, I used an additional component called the "Input System UI Input
                        Module," enabling the integration of the Input System with the UI system. This ensures players
                        can seamlessly interact with UI elements, such as buttons and sliders on menu scenes or other UI
                        scenes. For example, controller players can also navigate through buttons.
