            <h3>Item System</h3>
            <p>In Dracomaton, items add variety to the gameplay by giving players positive or negative effects that
                impact their abilities and strategy.</p>
            <p>I set up the item system’s foundation, including how new items are created, how each item’s unique
                effects work, and how these effects are applied to the player. Using Unity’s
                <strong>ScriptableObjects</strong>, I
                created a <code>BaseItem</code> class as the core for all items, establishing shared behaviors, such as
                cooldown management, while allowing specific items to have custom logic. This setup uses
                <strong>inheritance</strong> and
                <strong>polymorphism</strong> to make the item framework both scalable and adaptable.
            </p>

                <p class="image-caption">Resource Management System for organizing in-game assets.</p>
            </div>

            <p>To handle stat changes, I used a <stong>composition</stong> approach with <code>StatsModifier</code>
                collections that
                manage each item's status and stats modifiers. These modifiers are dynamically applied or removed when
                items are equipped, allowing for flexible adjustments to player stats like damage or health.</p>

            <p>Since designers would be working with items too, I designed the system to be easy to adjust directly in
                Unity’s Inspector. This setup lets designers test and fine-tune item strength just by changing values in
                the Inspector, making it faster to balance items without needing to touch the code.</p>

            <!-- Resource System Contribution -->
            <h3>Resource System</h3>
            <p>In Dracomaton, random items and rewards appear in different scenarios, such as shops or as rewards after
                clearing rooms. To manage these dynamic elements efficiently, I developed a <strong>Resource Management
                    System</strong>
                as a central controller for all in-game assets, including UI icons, items, VFX, and more. This system
                acts as a flexible helper function, simplifying resource organization and retrieval for both the
                <strong>Reward
                    System</strong> and the <strong>Shop System</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>ResourcesManager.cs</code> is a singleton class that loads various resources (like prefabs)
                from project folders into organized lists when the game starts. To keep the codebase clear and
                maintainable, I used a <strong>partial class</strong> structure that separates each resource type into
                its own manager.
                This structure allows for easy access to specific resources through dedicated functions, making it
                simple to spawn any item as needed. Additionally, each resource manager operates independently, so
                programmers can create and manage single resource types without cluttering a primary script.</p>
                <div class="contribution-image-container">
                    <img src="images/rmscript.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <img src="images/ResourcesManager.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                </div>
            <!-- Reward System Contribution -->
            <h3>Reward System</h3>
            <p>In Dracomaton, players receive different rewards based on the type of room they complete. For example,
                completing a health room grants a health potion. As the game progresses, various room types appear, each
                offering unique rewards.</p>
            <p>I created a <strong>Reward Spawner</strong> object that stores different reward prefabs, enabling dynamic
                and specific
                item drops.</p>
            <p> When a room is cleared, the Reward Spawner selects the appropriate reward type and checks
                for nearby available tiles to place the reward. Since tile maps are grid-based, I searched the tiles in
                a <strong>Spiral Pattern</strong> outward from the player within a specific range. This will help find
                the nearest
                available tile by only checking necessary tiles.</p>
                <div class="contribution-image-container">
                    <img src="images/rewardSpawners.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <img src="images/SpiralPattern.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <img src="images/dc10.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                </div>
            <p>I implemented a responsive and event-driven reward system using <strong>UnityEvents</strong> and
                <strong>delegates</strong>. This
                approach enables the reward spawner to be triggered directly by room events, reducing redundant
                references and keeping the code structure clean and modular.
            </p>

            <!-- Shop System Subtitle -->
            <h4>Shop System</h4>
            <p>For the Shop System, I was responsible for setting up three items in each shop room, providing players
                with varied options every time they entered. To achieve this, I created a Shop Item Position Prefab that
                can be easily placed anywhere in the scene. I also made a dynamic system that allows each shop item
                position to spawn either randomized or fixed items. The shop system also uses weighted randomization for
                shop item generation, making rarer items less likely to appear.</p>

                    <img src="images/ShopItemController.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <img src="images/dc9.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                </div>
            <!-- Mod Menu Subtitle -->
            <h4>Mod Menu</h4>
            <p>In Dracomaton, the Mod Menu is a key part of the game’s UI, built to handle two slot types: Form Slots
                (upper) and Mod Slots (lower). The menu allows players to customize their setup by dragging and swapping
                forms and mods between these slots.</p>
            <p>To make sure the UI changes reflected in the gameplay, I used Unity’s Drag and Drop (IDropHandler,
                IBeginDragHandler, and IDragHandler) Interface with a custom Draggable Item class. I structured the
                slots into Form Slot and Mod Slots to simplify tracking and syncing the UI with the player's actual
                equipment status. If an item can’t be equipped, the system displays visual cues to guide the player.</p>
