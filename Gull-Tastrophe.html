                    <p>Gull-Tastrophe is a 3D funny action-adventure game that lets players act as a seagull to poop and
                        create chaos everywhere. Enjoy life being a seagull and do whatever you want. The goal is to
                        beat the human out of your home island!

                    <p>I pitched this game and was green-lit by the program advisor. I was responsible for

            <h3>Game Progression</h3>
            <p>In Gull-Tastrophe, I was responsible for designing and implementing the Warning Level System and the
                Event System, both of which are essential to the game's progression mechanics. The warning level
                dynamically adjusts game difficulty, while the event system increases the warning level.</p>
            <h4>Warning Level System</h4>
            <p>The Warning Level System is key to game progression, as it dynamically changes the gameâ€™s difficulty by
                spawning more enemies, changing enemies' behavior, etc. To ensure flexibility and scalability, I
                designed the system to be highly modular and abstract, enabling it to integrate with other game systems.
            </p>
            <p>The system uses Event dispatchers to hook into related systems; for example, when the warning level
                increases, the Building System spawns more NPCs, and the UI System displays a banner. The warning level
                can be triggered by various in-game events, allowing it to affect multiple gameplay systems without
                redundant referencing.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>Event System</h3>
            <p>Handling different in-game events was tough, so I needed to build a solid and flexible system. My
                solution is to use a Data Table structure to store all the in-game events and an Event Manager to handle
                registration and processing efficiently. Events are categorized into three types: Normal Events, where
                scores are added directly to the warning level; Count Events, where scores accumulate only after the
                event has occurred a certain number of times; and Combo Events, where scores are stored temporarily and
                added when triggered by specific conditions</p>
            <div class="contribution-image-container">
                <img src="images/NormalEvent.gif" alt="Event System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                <img src="images/CountEvent.gif" alt="Event System Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div>
            <p>The centralized Event Manager registers events from various Blueprints and determines their type based on
                the Event Struct, using this categorization to decide how and when to add scores, making the process
                simpler of introducing new events or modifying existing ones. This approach minimizes conditional checks
                and avoids major modifications to the system when scaling or adding features.

            <!-- Resource System Contribution -->
            <h3>Destructible System</h3>
            <p>In Gull-Tastrophe, there are two types of destructible that players can destroy by either dashing or
                pooping. Each destructible has a specific amount of health and spawns rewards upon being destroyed.
            </p>
            <h4>Base Destructible Class</h4>
            <p>TTo handle the shared logic for destructibles, I created a Base Destructible Class that all destructible
                types inherit from. This class manages common functionality such as triggering explosion effects and
                spawning rewards. I set up a Box Collider inside the base destructible Blueprint to handle damage
                detection and combined Physics Fields with Geometry Collections to create visual explosion effects.
            </p>

                <img src="images/ResourcesManager.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div> -->
            <h4>Individual Destructible Types</h4>
            <!-- Reward System Contribution -->
            <p>Each destructible type extends the base class and adds unique behavior. For example: Destructible Police
                Station, Destructible Jar, Destructible Car. Using inheritance allows for easy adjustments and
                modifications of individual destructibles while keeping the shared logic centralized.
            </p>
            <div class="contribution-image-container">
                <img src="images/PoliceStation.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                <img src="images/Small.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div>
            <h4>Building System and Falling Logic</h4>
            <p>
                In the game, destructibles can be stacked on top of each other. Destroying one causes the ones above it
                to fall and shift down. To optimize performance, I implemented a "faked" physics system for this effect,
                using animations and mathematical calculations instead of real-time physics simulations.
                The Falling Logic is
                1. When a block is destroyed, it checks for an upper neighbor.
                2. If an upper neighbor exists, it recursively calls the Fall Event, setting the current block's
                position
                as the target location for the neighbor to fall to.
                3.This process continues until no neighbors are found.

            </p>
            <div class="contribution-image-container">
                <img src="images/BuildingFalling.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                <img src="images/BuildingFalling.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
            </div>
            <p>This approach provides greater control over the falling style and distance while being much cheaper in
                terms of performance compared to real-time physics simulations.
