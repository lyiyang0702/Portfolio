            <h3>Item System</h3>
            <p>In Dracomaton, items add variety to the gameplay by giving players positive or negative effects that
                impact their abilities and strategy.</p>
            <p>I set up the item system’s foundation, including how new items are created, how each item’s unique
                effects work, and how these effects are applied to the player. Using Unity’s
                <strong>ScriptableObjects</strong>, I
                created a <code>BaseItem</code> class as the core for all items, establishing shared behaviors, such as
                cooldown management, while allowing specific items to have custom logic. This setup uses
                <strong>inheritance</strong> and
                <strong>polymorphism</strong> to make the item framework both scalable and adaptable.
            </p>

                <p class="image-caption">Resource Management System for organizing in-game assets.</p>
            </div>

            <p>To handle stat changes, I used a <stong>composition</stong> approach with <code>StatsModifier</code>
                collections that
                manage each item's status and stats modifiers. These modifiers are dynamically applied or removed when
                items are equipped, allowing for flexible adjustments to player stats like damage or health.</p>

            <p>Since designers would be working with items too, I designed the system to be easy to adjust directly in
                Unity’s Inspector. This setup lets designers test and fine-tune item strength just by changing values in
                the Inspector, making it faster to balance items without needing to touch the code.</p>

            <!-- Resource System Contribution -->
            <h3>Resource System</h3>
            <p>In Dracomaton, random items and rewards appear in different scenarios, such as shops or as rewards after
                clearing rooms. To manage these dynamic elements efficiently, I developed a <strong>Resource Management
                    System</strong>
                as a central controller for all in-game assets, including UI icons, items, VFX, and more. This system
                acts as a flexible helper function, simplifying resource organization and retrieval for both the
                <strong>Reward
                    System</strong> and the <strong>Shop System</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>ResourcesManager.cs</code> is a singleton class that loads various resources (like prefabs)
                from project folders into organized lists when the game starts. To keep the codebase clear and
                maintainable, I used a <strong>partial class</strong> structure that separates each resource type into
                its own manager.
                This structure allows for easy access to specific resources through dedicated functions, making it
                simple to spawn any item as needed. Additionally, each resource manager operates independently, so
                programmers can create and manage single resource types without cluttering a primary script.</p>
                <!-- <div class="contribution-image-container">
                    <img src="images/rmscript.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <img src="images/ResourcesManager.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                </div> -->
            <!-- Reward System Contribution -->
            <h3>Reward System</h3>
            <p>In Dracomaton, players receive different rewards based on the type of room they complete. For example,
                completing a health room grants a health potion. As the game progresses, various room types appear, each
                offering unique rewards.</p>
            <p>I created a <strong>Reward Spawner</strong> object that stores different reward prefabs, enabling dynamic
                and specific
                item drops.</p>
            <p> When a room is cleared, the Reward Spawner selects the appropriate reward type and checks
                for nearby available tiles to place the reward. Since tile maps are grid-based, I searched the tiles in
                a <strong>Spiral Pattern</strong> outward from the player within a specific range. This will help find
                the nearest
                available tile by only checking necessary tiles.</p>
                <div class="contribution-image-container">
                    <img src="images/rewardSpawners.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <!-- <img src="images/SpiralPattern.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" /> -->
                    <img src="images/dc10.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                </div>
            <p>I implemented a responsive and event-driven reward system using <strong>UnityEvents</strong> and
                <strong>delegates</strong>. This
                approach enables the reward spawner to be triggered directly by room events, reducing redundant
                references and keeping the code structure clean and modular.
            </p>

            <!-- Shop System Subtitle -->
            <h4>Shop System</h4>
            <p>For the Shop System, I was responsible for setting up three items in each shop room, providing players
                with varied options every time they entered. To achieve this, I created a Shop Item Position Prefab that
                can be easily placed anywhere in the scene. I also made a dynamic system that allows each shop item
                position to spawn either randomized or fixed items. The shop system also uses weighted randomization for
                shop item generation, making rarer items less likely to appear.</p>
                <div class="contribution-image-container">
                    <img src="images/ShopItemController.png" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                    <img src="images/dc9.gif" alt="Resource System Example" class="contribution-image" />
                </div>
            <!-- Mod Menu Subtitle -->
            <h4>Mod Menu</h4>
            <p>In Dracomaton, the Mod Menu is a key part of the game’s UI, built to handle two slot types: Form Slots
                (upper) and Mod Slots (lower). The menu allows players to customize their setup by dragging and swapping
                forms and mods between these slots.</p>
            <p>To make sure the UI changes reflected in the gameplay, I used Unity’s Drag and Drop (IDropHandler,
                IBeginDragHandler, and IDragHandler) Interface with a custom Draggable Item class. I structured the
                slots into Form Slot and Mod Slots to simplify tracking and syncing the UI with the player's actual
                equipment status. If an item can’t be equipped, the system displays visual cues to guide the player.</p>

                    <div id="item" style="display: none;">
                        In Dracomaton, items play a crucial role by introducing both positive and negative effects on
                        players that significantly impact gameplay. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc11.gif">
                        <img src="images/ItemOverview.png"><br>
                        My responsibilities involved establishing the foundation for the item system. This encompassed
                        creating a framework for generating new items, adding distinctive effects to each item, and
                        implementing the mechanics for applying these effects to the player. To achieve this, I used
                        Unity's ScriptableObjects to devise a base class, BaseItem, which serves as the base prefabs for
                        all future items. Each base item owns unique attributes such as id, icon, and employs Item Stats
                        Mods & Item Status Mods to manage its distinctive effects. When the Apply function in the base
                        item script gets called, it will add all the mods(aka. effects) to its host damage
                        source/damageable, mostly player.
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/ItemCode.png"><br>
                        Considering that designers will collaborate on items throughout the development, I designed a
                        user-friendly system that allows designers to swiftly test and tweak item attributes during
                        tests by adjusting parameters directly in the Inspector.<br>
                        <img src="images/ItemInspector.png"><br>

                    <div id="resources" style="display: none;">

                        In Dracomaton, random objects need to be spawned on the map under different situations, for
                        example, shop items are randomly selected from all the items in the game. To address the random
                        spawning of objects, including shop items. This system organizes all game resources, such as UI
                        icons, Damage Text, and VFX, into a unified structure.<br>
                        <h2> Resources Manager</h2>
                        The Resource Manager, implemented as a singleton class, efficiently fetches resource objects and
                        categorizes them based on type when awake.<br>
                        <img src="images/ResourcesManager.png"> <img src="images/fetchItem.png"> <img
                            src="images/rmscript.png"><br>
                        For code clarity, I used partial class to separate the code into different files. Individual
                        resource managers also make generating a random object more easily by just calling the function
                        in the corresponding manager script, and programmers can create many single manager scripts
                        without complicated primary resources manager script.<br>

                        <h2> Reward System</h2>
                        In Dracomaton, players receive varied rewards based on the type of room they complete,
                        for example, clearing a health room will reward the player a health portion. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc8.gif"> <img src="images/dc10.gif"><br>
                        The Reward Spawner selects the reward type based on the current room's type from reading the
                        current room controller, and the Reward Script ensures appropriate spawning within reachable
                        areas (e.g. avoid water area) near the player.
                        <br>

                        <img src="images/rewardSpawners.png"> <img src="images/spawnRewards.png"><br>


                        <h2> Shop System</h2>
                        As for the Shop System, I was responsible for offering three shop items (mostly the same object
                        as rewards) in the Shop room to players. One item is always a Health portion for game balance,
                        and the other is a random type of object (items, forms, etc). <br>
                        <img src="images/dc9.gif"><br>
                        A prefab with preset spawning methods facilitates the placement of shop items on the screen,
                        which can be easily placed in any position on the map. Shop Room Manager populates three shop
                        item positions, and the attached Shop Item Spawning Script manages object spawning on these
                        positions. The variable "Item Type" in the spawning script decides the type of spawned objects,
                        for instance, if item type is Random, it means this position will spawn a random object,
                        otherwise, it will only spawn the selected type of item.<br>

                        <img src="images/shopItem.png"> <img src="images/shopItem1.png"> <br>

                    </div>

                    <div id="mod" style="display: none;">

                        <h2> Mod Menu </h2>
                        Mod Menu is the crucial game UI in Dracomaton. There are two types of slots on the menu: the
                        upper slots are Form slots, and the lower slots are Mods slots. The mechanics of Dracomaton is
                        that players can switch the form and mod by swapping their positions. For example, if players
                        drag Fire Form to the Construct Form’s mod slot, the code will automatically unequip Fire Form
                        and turn it into Construct Form’s mod. <br>
                        <img src="images/dc6.gif"><br>
                        I crafted this feature from scratch, integrating UI assets, functions, and connecting them to
                        backend codes. Consideration was given to various restrictions, such as preventing the same form
                        from being modded or equipped twice, ensuring the player understands our mechanics correctly.<br>
                        <img src="images/dc7.gif"><br>
                        <h2> Item Menu</h2>
                        Item Menu UI will pop out with three item options when the player clears an item room, and they
                        can read through the item description to select one to apply. They simply need to click the card
                        to use the item. If the item pool has less than three available items, it will only spawn two
                        items for selection.<br>
                        <img src="images/dc11.gif"> <img src="images/itemSelection.png"><br>

                        Both the Mod Menu and Item Menu panels are toggleable.
